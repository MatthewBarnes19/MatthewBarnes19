%% This was created by Matthew Barnes during PHY 266. The purpose of this code is to model the path of a baseball with and without drag, as well as find the optimal launch angle for a baseball. The code is modifiable to work as a general projectile motion model

clear;
x(1)=0; %set initial position to 0
y(1)=.76; %set initial height to 0
v=49.2; %set initial velocity

theta=29; %set angle of baseball to 29 degrees
radian=theta*pi/180; %Convert angle to radians

vx(1)=v*cos(radian); %Calculate x velocity of baseball
vy(1)=v*sin(radian); %calculate y velocity of baseball

t(1)=0; %set initial time to 0

% perform intermediate drag calculations
D=.074;
c=.000155*D;

m=.148; %set mass
g=-9.8; %set gravity
NPTS=1000; %Number of time points
dt=10/NPTS; %Find delta t, that is the timestep
ax(1)=-c*vx/m; %calculate initial x acceleration
ay(1)=g-c*vy/m; %calculate initial y acceleration
for i=1:NPTS %run from 1 to the end of the vector
    t(i+1)=t(i)+dt; %iterate over time
    x(i+1)=x(i)+vx(i)*dt; %iterate over position
    y(i+1)=y(i)+vy(i)*dt; %iterate over height
    ax(i+1)=-c*vx(i)/m; %iterate over acceleration of position
    ay(i+1)=g-c*vy(i)/m; %iterate over acceleration of height
    vx(i+1)=vx(i)+(ax(i+1))*dt; %iterate over velocity (x)
    vy(i+1)=vy(i)+(ay(i+1))*dt;%iterate over velocity (y)
    if y(i+1)<0 %end code when ball hits the field
        break;
